# About Me

## Interests

### Video Games
I have enjoyed video games since I was a child, with some of my personal childhood favorites including:  
- _Kingdom Hearts_
- _Ratchet & Clank_
- _Uncharted_
- _Cytus_ (little rhythm game that I got really into as a kid)

Nowadays, I have different, albeit similar, interests in games, such as:
- _Marvel Rivals_
- _Warframe_
- _NieR: Automata_ (personally my favorite game of all time, I really enjoy the deeper questions and meanings that are posed in the game, and I think is the foundation of my enjoyment of deeper questions and introspection)
- _osu!_

### Music
I've always enjoyed music, spanning over a multitude of different genres. I don't particularly have a personal favorite song, though I usually have several favorites at any given time. Currently, I've been really enjoying **_Epic: The Musical_**, which is a musical rendition of the Odyssey. I highly recommend giving it a listen if you have the time.  

As for some of my current favorite songs, here they are!
- _Kilby Girl_ - The Backseat Lovers
- _Chatterbox_ - Casey Lee Williams (I enjoy a lot of the higher tempo songs in RWBY, it has a really good soundtrack)
- _Eleanor Rigby_ - Cody Fry
- _The Line_ - Twenty One Pilots (Specifically the one performed at the 2024 game awards)
- _All In_ - Marino
- _Kisaragi_ - Camellia (I don't listen to Camellia half as much as I used to, but he is one of my favorite artists for hype songs, and is an icon for rhythm games as a whole)

## Sites I frequent
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - There's always something to watch on there between all of the people that I'm subscribed to, and if there isn't, then there's always music that I can listen to instead.
- [Warframe Fandom](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki) - As there is a lot of content within the game, it's pretty useful to visit this site and its various subsites in order to find what I'm looking for at any given time.
