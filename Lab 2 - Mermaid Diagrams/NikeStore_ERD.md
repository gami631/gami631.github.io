### Relationships: 
- **CUSTOMER to SALE (1-to-many):**  
    Each customer can make many sales, while each sale can only be attributed to one customer. This helps the store track who buys what, enabling personalized service, marketing, and loyalty programs.

- **PRODUCT to SALE (1-to-many):**  
    Each sale record represents the purchase of exactly one product. Over time, many sales records can be made for the same product. This allows the business to monitor sales performance of each shoe model and manage pricing or promotions effectively.

- **PRODUCT to INVENTORY (1-to-1):**  
    Each product has one inventory record tracking stock. This is essential for knowing how many shoes are available, preventing stockouts, and managing restocking efficiently.
